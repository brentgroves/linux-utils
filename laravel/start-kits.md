Introduction
To give you a head start building your new Laravel application, we are happy to offer authentication and application starter kits. These kits automatically scaffold your application with the routes, controllers, and views you need to register and authenticate your application's users.

While you are welcome to use these starter kits, they are not required. You are free to build your own application from the ground up by simply installing a fresh copy of Laravel. Either way, we know you will build something great!

Laravel Breeze
Laravel Breeze is a minimal, simple implementation of all of Laravel's authentication features, including login, registration, password reset, email verification, and password confirmation. In addition, Breeze includes a simple "profile" page where the user may update their name, email address, and password.

Laravel Breeze's default view layer is made up of simple Blade templates styled with Tailwind CSS. Or, Breeze can scaffold your application using Vue or React and Inertia.

Breeze provides a wonderful starting point for beginning a fresh Laravel application and is also a great choice for projects that plan to take their Blade templates to the next level with Laravel Livewire.
