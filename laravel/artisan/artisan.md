what is laravel artisan
https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/artisan#introduction
Artisan is the command line interface included with Laravel. Artisan exists at the root of your application as the artisan script and provides a number of helpful commands that can assist you while you build your application. To view a list of all available Artisan commands, you may use the list command:

php artisan list

Every command also includes a "help" screen which displays and describes the command's available arguments and options. To view a help screen, precede the name of the command with help:

php artisan help migrate
