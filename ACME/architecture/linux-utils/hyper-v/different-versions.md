# What are the different versions of Hyper-V
**[Hyper-V version types](https://cloudinfrastructureservices.co.uk/hyper-v-vs-esxi-whats-the-difference/)**
Three versions of Hyper-V are available: Hyper-V for Windows Servers, **[Hyper-V Servers](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-hyper-v-server-2019)**, and Hyper-V for Windows 10. 

Primarily, Hyper-V, allows the creation and operation of a software virtual machine (VM). With Hyper-V, numerous virtual machines run simultaneously on a single computer, each with its operating system. 

Microsoft Hyper-V is a Type 1 Hypervisor in addition to being a Type 2 Hypervisor. In Hyper-V, there are parent and child partitions. The host OS is run on the parent partition, while each child partition is a virtual machine (VM) with an installed guest operating system. The same hardware resources are used by the host, the VMs, and both.

It is possible to create many virtual machines on a single Hyper-V host. You can also check out Azure Hyper-V and understand how to set it up on the Azure cloud platform. Three versions of Hyper-V are available: Hyper-V for Windows Servers, Hyper-V Servers, and Hyper-V for Windows 10. 

Importantly, Hyper-V for Windows Servers is a property of the Windows Server operating system. As with Hyper-V for Windows Servers, Hyper-V Servers is a standalone program that you may use to administer virtual and dedicated server instances. 

The version of Hyper-V that operates on your laptop also runs on Windows 10. You require a 64-bit OS to enable Hyper-V on your Windows device. Hence, Windows 10 is not the only option, though. Windows 8.1 also functions.
