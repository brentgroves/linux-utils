Model View Controller architecture
PHP frameworks typically follow the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern. This concept separates the manipulation of data from its presentation.

The Model stores the business logic and application data. It passes data to the View, the presentation layer. The User interacts with the View and can input instructions via the Controller. The Controller gives these commands to the Model, and the cycle continues.
Model: a database
View: a HTML page or pages
Controller: functions to access and update the database

What Should You Look for in a PHP Framework?
Here are some factors you need to consider when choosing the best PHP framework for your project.

Firstly, if you’re new to a PHP framework, the learning curve shouldn’t be too steep. You don’t want to invest precious time learning a framework if it’s too tricky to grasp. Luckily, PHP is one of the best programming languages to learn.

Next, you want a framework that is easy to use and saves you time.

A PHP framework should meet your technical requirements for a project. Most frameworks will have a minimum PHP version and certain PHP extensions that they work with. Make sure that your framework supports your database(s) of choice, and that you can use the framework with the web server that you want to deploy to.

Choose a framework with the right balance of features. A feature-rich framework can be a boon for some projects. On the other hand, if you don’t need many features, pick a framework that is stripped down and minimal.

Some desirable features are:

Testing
Cache storage
Templating engine: a way to output PHP within HTML using a PHP class
Security
If you need to build an application that is scalable, select a framework that supports this.

Finally, good documentation and support are important so that you can make the most of your PHP framework. A framework with a large and vibrant community is also more likely to stand the test of time and is also able to assist you when you run into difficulties.
