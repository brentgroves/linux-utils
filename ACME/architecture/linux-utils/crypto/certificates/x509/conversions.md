As you work with digital certificates, you may find yourself with the need to convert between PEM and DER files, view their contents as human-readable text, or combine them into common container formats like PKCS#12 or PKCS#7. This guide points out the major differences between PEM and DER files and common filename extensions associated with them. It also provides visual examples of each encoding, and illustrates some common file format conversions with OpenSSL.

What is OpenSSL?
OpenSSL is a very useful open-source command-line toolkit for working with X.509 certificates, certificate signing requests (CSRs), and cryptographic keys. If you are using a UNIX variant like Linux or macOS, OpenSSL is probably already installed on your computer. If you would like to use OpenSSL on Windows, you can enable Windows 10â€™s Linux subsystem or install Cygwin.
