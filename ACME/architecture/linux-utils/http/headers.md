6.3. Header Fields
Fields (Section 5) that are sent or received before the content are referred to as "header fields" (or just "headers", colloquially).

The "header section" of a message consists of a sequence of header field lines. Each header field might modify or extend message semantics, describe the sender, define the content, or provide additional context.

Note: We refer to named fields specifically as a "header field" when they are only allowed to be sent in the header section.
