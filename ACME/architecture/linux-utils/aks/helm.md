Helm is an open-source packaging tool that helps you install and manage the lifecycle of Kubernetes applications. Similar to Linux package managers like APT and Yum, Helm manages Kubernetes charts, which are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.

In this quickstart, you'll use Helm to package and run an application on AKS. For more details on installing an existing application using Helm, see Install existing applications with Helm in AKS.
