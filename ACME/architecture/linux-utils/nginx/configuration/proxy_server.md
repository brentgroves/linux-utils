Setting Up a Simple Proxy Server
One of the frequent uses of nginx is setting it up as a proxy server, which means a server that receives requests, passes them to the proxied servers, retrieves responses from them, and sends them to the clients.

We will configure a basic proxy server, which serves requests of images with files from the local directory and sends all other requests to a proxied server. In this example, both servers will be defined on a single nginx instance.

First, define the proxied server by adding one more server block to the nginx’s configuration file with the following contents:

server {
    listen 8080;
    root /data/up1;

    location / {
    }
}

This will be a simple server that listens on the port 8080 (previously, the listen directive has not been specified since the standard port 80 was used) and maps all requests to the /data/up1 directory on the local file system. Create this directory and put the index.html file into it. Note that the root directive is placed in the server context. Such root directive is used when the location block selected for serving a request does not include its own root directive.

Next, use the server configuration from the previous section and modify it to make it a proxy server configuration. In the first location block, put the proxy_pass directive with the protocol, name and port of the proxied server specified in the parameter (in our case, it is http://localhost:8080):

server {
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
    }

    location /images/ {
        root /data;
    }
}


We will modify the second location block, which currently maps requests with the /images/ prefix to the files under the /data/images directory, to make it match the requests of images with typical file extensions. The modified location block looks like this:

location ~ \.(gif|jpg|png)$ {
    root /data/images;
}

The parameter is a regular expression matching all URIs ending with .gif, .jpg, or .png. A regular expression should be preceded with ~. The corresponding requests will be mapped to the /data/images directory.

When nginx selects a location block to serve a request it first checks location directives that specify prefixes, remembering location with the longest prefix, and then checks regular expressions. If there is a match with a regular expression, nginx picks this location or, otherwise, it picks the one remembered earlier.

The resulting configuration of a proxy server will look like this:

server {
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/;
    }

    location ~ \.(gif|jpg|png)$ {
        root /data/images;
    }
}

This server will filter requests ending with .gif, .jpg, or .png and map them to the /data/images directory (by adding URI to the root directive’s parameter) and pass all other requests to the proxied server configured above.

To apply new configuration, send the reload signal to nginx as described in the previous sections.

There are many more directives that may be used to further configure a proxy connection.
