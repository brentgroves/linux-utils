What is a session border controller (SBC)?
A session border controller (SBC) is a dedicated hardware device or software application that governs the manner in which phone calls are initiated, conducted and terminated on a voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) network. Phone calls are referred to as sessions.

An SBC acts as a router between a network and carrier service, enabling only authorized sessions to pass through the connection point or border. An SBC defines and monitors the quality of service (QoS) status for all sessions, ensuring that callers can actually communicate with each other and that emergency calls are delivered correctly and prioritized above all other calls. An SBC can also serve as a firewall for session traffic, applying its own QoS rules and identifying specific incoming threats to the communications environment.

For security reasons, session border controllers are likely to be deployed on both the carrier and enterprise sides of the connection. An SBC on the corporate network side is referred to as an enterprise SBC (E-SBC).

Functions of an SBC
SBCs control the admission of calls in and out of the networks. They often provide measurement, access control and data conversion for calls. SBCs modify the stream of call signaling data in each call, as well as redirect media traffic. They enable interoperability -- or the exchange and use of information between software -- by assimilating different signaling stream headers and messages. This enables systems that use different protocols to communicate with each other. Connections between different voice and video codecs can be translated as well.

SBCs also protect Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), which is used in VoIP networks. SIP is also one of the most important parts of any implementation for traditional service providers. It is a bedrock standard that governs how devices communicate over the internet.
