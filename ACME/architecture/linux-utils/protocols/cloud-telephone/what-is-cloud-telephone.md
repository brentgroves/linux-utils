Cloud telephony for business is an important part of cloud strategy. Like other cloud services, cloud telephony helps streamline and improve essential business processes. The business world has changed, particularly since 2020, and employees are now far less likely to be in the office. Professionals today will spend time working from home, from client offices or cafes, and on the move. So why is their business phone still in the office?

A better solution is cloud telephony. Itâ€™s a market that is expected to grow by almost 18 percent in 2021 as more businesses make the switch. Switching away from an on-premises PBX offers greater flexibility for a workforce that is increasingly mobile. It provides one number to reach employees wherever they are. It also allows businesses to bundle telephony with their communications and collaboration suite. Helping to cut costs and reduce the number of apps employees need to use.
