Why Use PowerDNS?
PowerDNS provides two nameserver solutions:

The Authoritative Server, which uses the database to resolve queries about domains.
The Recursor, which consults with other authoritative servers to resolve queries.
Other nameservers combine the two functions automatically. PowerDNS offers them separately, and allows the mix of the two solutions seamlessly for a modular setup.

Additionally, PowerDNS is open source, works equally well for small and large query volumes, and offers many possibilities for backend solutions.
