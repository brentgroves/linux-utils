Dear Son,
I love you and will direct you.  I am with you always and my love for you is unconditional. What I want for you is a life filled with joy, peace, and happiness.  To have this you must believe the things that I teach you.  But don't worry I will help you to believe in my love and in the things that I have taught you.  Now, hang in there, and do not worry about anything for I am with you always and am in control of all situations.
