"Data scraping, also known as web scraping, is the process of importing information from a website into a spreadsheet or local file saved on your computer. It’s one of the most efficient ways to get data from the web, and in some cases to channel that data to another website. "

What are Time Series Metrics?
A time series is a sequence of sequential data points that occur over a particular interval of time. A “metric”, in this case, refers to the piece of data that is tracked at each increment of time.

A time series metric has two main features:

Measurable: this means that you can assign a numeric value to it
Variable: this means the metric changes over time
One important difference about time series data is that time is not just a metric (like the piece of data being collected), but rather it is the primary axis. This means that each numeric data point is paired with a timestamp and one or more labeled dimensions associated with the metric. It should be noted that the time intervals between each data point are most often gathered at regular intervals, although they can also be irregular.

Time series also consists of 4 main components:

Level: this refers to the average, baseline value of a time series as if it were a straight line
Trends: this means that variations in the data move up or down in trends or reasonably predictable patterns.
Seasonality: this means that there are seasonal variations that repeat over a specific time period, for example, each day, week, month, or year.
Variability: also known as “noise” or “volatility” ”,this refers to random variations that don’t fall into any of the other three categories.
The Different Types of Time Series Metrics
Now that we have a high-level definition, let’s look at a few of the different types of time series metrics.
