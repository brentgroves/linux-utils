You can use Azure DNS to host your DNS domain and manage your DNS records. By hosting your domains in Azure, you can manage your DNS records by using the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing as your other Azure services.

Suppose you buy the domain contoso.com from a domain name registrar and then create a zone with the name contoso.com in Azure DNS. Since you're the owner of the domain, your registrar offers you the option to configure the name server (NS) records for your domain. The registrar stores the NS records in the .com parent zone. Internet users around the world are then directed to your domain in your Azure DNS zone when they try to resolve DNS records in contoso.com.
