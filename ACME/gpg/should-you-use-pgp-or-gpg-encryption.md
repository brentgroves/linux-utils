Is Open PGP the Same as PGP or GPG?
 

Not quite. PGP is the basis or structure that stands behind Open PGP. Open PGP is a non-proprietary protocol, whereas PGP is a proprietary solution owned by Symantec. Open PGP uses public key or asymmetric cryptography and can be applied to features, tools, or more fleshed out solutions that support open-source PGP encryption technology. Open PGP also addresses the issues of data authentication and non-repudiation with the ability to "sign" files via embedded digital signatures.

What is GPG?
 

GNU Privacy Guard (GPG), sometimes referred to as GnuPG, is simply a different implementation of the Open PGP encryption standard as defined by RFC 4880, the official name of the Open PGP standard.

GPG allows users to interface with a GUI or command line which can integrate encryption with emails and operating systems like Linux. It integrates well with other solutions, opening and decrypting files encrypted by PGP or Open PGP. GPG was released as an alternative to Symantec's encryption tools. GPG, like Open PGP, is available as a free software download and is based on the Open PGP encryption standards established by the IETF.
