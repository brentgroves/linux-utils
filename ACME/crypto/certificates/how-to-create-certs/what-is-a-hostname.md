What is a hostname?
The hostname of a server is what the server is called within the network. The hostname also allows you to easily identify your server and it provides ease of use.

Especially if you have a few active servers in your client area it can be hard to find the right server. So you should see your hostname as a ‘nickname’.

While a hostname may technically be a short name (i.e. without the domain) we recommend you to use a fully qualified domain name as your hostname since almost all of our OS templates which are used for installation will setup various parts of your OS according to what’s entered here.

Let’s say you own the domain example.com and you want to setup a new server. You might configure the hostname as host.example.com.

ATTENTION: Unless you actually own the domain example.com do NOT use host.example.com as your hostname! Replace example.com with your own domain name!
