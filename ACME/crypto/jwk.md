1. Introduction
A JSON Web Key (JWK) is a JSON data structure that represents a set of public keys as a JSON object [RFC4627]. The JWK format is used to represent bare keys; representing certificate chains is an explicit non-goal of this specification. JSON Web Keys are referenced in JSON Web Signatures (JWSs) [JWS] using the jku (JSON Key URL) header parameter.
