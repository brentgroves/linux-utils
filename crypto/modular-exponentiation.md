modular exponentiation

Modular exponentiation is exponentiation performed over a modulus. It is useful in computer science, especially in the field of public-key cryptography, where it is used in both Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange and RSA public/private keys.

Modular exponentiation is the remainder when an integer b (the base) is raised to the power e (the exponent), and divided by a positive integer m (the modulus); that is, c = be mod m. From the definition of division, it follows that 0 â‰¤ c < m.

For example, given b = 5, e = 3 and m = 13, dividing 53 = 125 by 13 leaves a remainder of c = 8.
