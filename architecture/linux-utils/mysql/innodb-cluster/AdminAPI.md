Using MySQL AdminAPI
AdminAPI is provided by MySQL Shell. AdminAPI is accessed through the dba global variable and its associated methods. The dba variable's methods provide the operations which enable you to deploy, configure, and administer InnoDB Cluster, InnoDB ClusterSet, and InnoDB ReplicaSet. For example, use the dba.createCluster() method to create an InnoDB Cluster. In addition, AdminAPI supports administration of some MySQL Router related tasks, such as creating or upgrading a user account that works with InnoDB Cluster, InnoDB ClusterSet, and InnoDB ReplicaSet.
