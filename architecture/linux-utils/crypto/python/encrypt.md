(Python) Encrypt File using X.509 Certificate using AES in CBC Mode
Demonstrates how to encrypt a file using an X.509 Certificate's public key, where the underlying bulk encryption algorithm is 128-bit AES in CBC mode. (The underlying bulk encryption algorithm can be specified to be other algorithms/strengths.)
