Popular Kubernetes Operators
There are many popular Kubernetes operators available that can be used to deploy and manage applications on a Kubernetes cluster. Some of the most popular operators include:

Prometheus
Prometheus is a popular open-source monitoring and alerting system. It is designed to collect metrics from various sources, including Kubernetes, and store them in a time-series database. Prometheus can be used to monitor the health and performance of a Kubernetes cluster, and to trigger alerts when certain conditions are met.

Grafana
Grafana is an open-source visualization and analytics platform. It is often used in conjunction with Prometheus to display metrics and provide insights into the performance and health of a system. Grafana provides a range of visualization options, including graphs, gauges, and dashboards, and can be used to monitor a variety of metrics.

RBAC Manager
RBAC Manager is a Kubernetes operator that helps to manage role-based access control (RBAC) in a cluster. It provides a set of custom resources for defining and managing RBAC rules, and includes features such as automatic synchronization of RBAC rules with the cluster state.
