Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool that is used to deploy and manage containerized applications on the cloud or within on-premises servers.

The smallest deployable units that you can create and manage in Kubernetes are pods. A pod encapsulates one or more containerized applications. Configuring a single container in a pod is a common use case, but there are scenarios where encapsulating multiple containers in a pod is necessary. This usually occurs when there are two or more containers that are tightly coupled to each other and need to share the same resources.
