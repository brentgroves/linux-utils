The SKS synchronising keyserver network is made up of a variety of keyservers run by the open source community. They synchronise OpenPGP public key updates using the SKS large-dataset reconciliation protocol.

The links below provide information about the SKS synchronising keyserver network. Synchronising keyservers typically use the newer hockeypuck or older sks-keyserver software packages.

Other non-synchronising keyservers exist, e.g. keys.openpgp.org. These are beyond the scope of this service.
