All pass is doing here is storing the generated file in an encrypted plain text file in a folder located at $HOME/.password-store and in case you were wondering, yes since itâ€™s just an encrypted plain text file you can store whatever you want in there! Such as notes etc. I often use mine to keep encrypted IP addresses of servers and what ports they are using.

Since we no longer need our test password lets get rid of it:

pass rm test
