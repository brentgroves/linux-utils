The Synchronizing OpenPGP Key Server (SKS)ÔÉÅ
To run you own keyserver, be it for your own personal use or network, or to be part of the pool, run the Synchronizing OpenPGP Key Server (SKS) software on your server.

SKS is an OpenPGP key server that correctly handles all OpenPGP features defined in RFC 2440, including photoID packages and multiple subkeys.

This keyserver implementation uses an efficient and reliable reconciliation algorithm to keep the database in sync with other SKS servers. Additionally it can both send and receive PKS style sync emails.
