This tip provides the necessary steps to mount a VPSA SMB share using Ubuntu. 

Step 1: Install the CIFS Utils pkg

sudo apt-get install cifs-utils

Step 2: Create a mount point

sudo mkdir /mnt/local_share

Step 3: Mount the volume

sudo mount -t cifs -o user=admin //172.20.1.34/home /mnt/local_share

sudo mount -t cifs //<vpsa_ip_address>/<export_share> /mnt/<local_share>

External RAID Enclosure
A QNAP external RAID enclosure is a flexible dual-mode storage device with RAID protection. In NAS storage mode, the enclosure can be used as an expansion unit to increase NAS storage. In external storage mode, the enclosure appears as a USB disk and can be used to transfer data between NAS devices, PCs, and Mac computers.
To configure an external RAID enclosure go to "Disks/VJBOD", select the enclosure, and then select "Action" > "Configure". After configuring RAID, you can format each external RAID group as a virtual disk or use it to create NAS storage space
Note: Certain RAID and disk operations are not supported when using an external RAID enclosure. For more details, check the enclosure specifications at www.qnap.com.
To expand NAS storage space, the external RAID enclosure must be configured with exactly one RAID group.
NoteSome external RAID device models do not support Software Control mode and can only be used in NAS storage mode. For details on supported features, see the device's product specifications.

What is JBOD?
JBOD, which stands for Just a Bunch of Disks or Just a Bunch of Drives, is a storage architecture consisting of numerous disk drives inside of a single storage enclosure.

JBOD enclosures are usually not configured to act as a RAID, but they can be.

By their very nature, JBOD enclosures are storage capacity monoliths.

The ruggedized 3MAG JBOD, for example, is equipped with 24 8TB solid-state drives per magazine, which amounts to a whopping 192TB of storage. The space, speed and rugged characteristics of this particular enclosure make it ideal for big data applications and local storage.

REQUEST PRICING
The drives in a JBOD enclosure can function as individual units, undergo disk spanning to act as one unit or be configured to act as a RAID with the right host system technology.

Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) is a storage technology that creates a data loss fail-safe by merging two or more hard disk drives (HDDs) or solid-state drives (SSDs) into one cohesive storage unit or array.

There are many different RAID levels, but the most common are RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5, RAID 6 and RAID 10.

RAID Configurations: Processes and Fault Tolerance
Raid Level	Raid 0	Raid 1	Raid 5	Raid 6	Raid 10
Process	Data Striping	Disk Mirroring	Striping + Parity	Striping + Double Parity	Mirroring + Striping
Tolerance	Not Fault-Tolerant	Fault-Tolerant	Fault-Tolerant	Fault-Tolerant	Fault-Tolerant
 

RAID storage protects against the total loss of a disk drive’s data by repeating or recreating that data and storing it on the additional drive or drives, a process also known as data redundancy. 

How does JBOD compare to RAID?
JBOD and RAID use different processes to store data.

When functioning as one unit, JBOD uses a process called spanning. When one disk drive in the enclosure reaches its capacity, data is stored on the next drive in the enclosure, and so on throughout the entire unit. Data is not fragmented, duplicated or combined as with RAID.

The various RAID levels use a variety of storage processes to achieve data redundancy and fault tolerance, including striping, mirroring, a combination of striping and mirroring, parity and double parity.

For example, RAID 0 uses striping only, which fragments data onto the drives in the array and offers no data redundancy, while RAID 1 uses mirroring only, which duplicates data onto the drives and offers data redundancy, albeit a less than outstanding degree of fault tolerance.

Like RAID, JBOD enclosures can make use of both hard disk drives and solid-state drives of varying storage capacities and interfaces, including lightning-fast NVME SSDs, which Trenton Systems uses in its JBOD enclosures.

JBOD enclosures and most RAID levels allow for hot swapping, meaning a drive in the enclosure or array can be replaced without shutting down the host system.

This is especially useful in programs and applications where users need frequent access to data stored on various servers.

Shutting down an entire system for drive replacement increases organizational downtime, and in turn, decreases productivity.

In mission-critical programs and applications, significant downtime and decreased productivity may have catastrophic consequences, such as financial loss, public outcry, serious injury and even death.
