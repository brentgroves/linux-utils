When the Nest IoC container instantiates a CatsController, it first looks for any dependencies*. When it finds the CatsService dependency, it performs a lookup on the CatsService token, which returns the CatsService class, per the registration step (#3 above). Assuming SINGLETON scope (the default behavior), Nest will then either create an instance of CatsService, cache it, and return it, or if one is already cached, return the existing instance.

*This explanation is a bit simplified to illustrate the point. One important area we glossed over is that the process of analyzing the code for dependencies is very sophisticated, and happens during application bootstrapping. One key feature is that dependency analysis (or "creating the dependency graph"), is transitive. In the above example, if the CatsService itself had dependencies, those too would be resolved. The dependency graph ensures that dependencies are resolved in the correct order - essentially "bottom up". This mechanism relieves the developer from having to manage such complex dependency graphs.
